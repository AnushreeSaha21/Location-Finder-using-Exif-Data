# Location-Finder-using-Exif-Data

---------------------------------------- PROJECT SYNOPSIS ----------------------------------------

The Location Finding App with Image EXIF Data is a unique application that
allows users to find the location and route of a place by simply uploading an image
with EXIF data. The objective of this project is to create a platform that works
similarly to Google Maps but with the twist of using an image as input instead of text.

The project aims to utilize the EXIF data available in the image to extract essential
information such as altitude, longitude, and latitude. This data would be used to
determine the location and route of the place, making it easier for users to find their
way without having to type in the place name.

The project's scope includes developing a user-friendly interface that allows users to
upload images with ease and a robust algorithm that extracts the required information
from the EXIF data. The application will be built using the Agile Software
Development methodology, ensuring that it is flexible and adaptable to changing
requirements.

In terms of technical feasibility, the project's algorithm will be based on well-
established image processing techniques, ensuring that it is efficient and accurate. The

operational feasibility of the project will be ensured by conducting rigorous testing
before deployment to ensure that it meets the user's requirements.

Overall, the Location Finding App with Image EXIF Data is an innovative project that
has the potential to revolutionize the way we find locations and routes.
